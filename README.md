# AI-Medical-Fraud-Detection
*Note: although name of the file is MedicalFraud1, it is of insurance dataset
I tried 5 types of machine learning models for the MedicalFraud1 dataset:                         
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest Classification
4) Gradient Boosting
5) Naive Bayes

And tested their accuracies

- Unzip the file "MedicalFraud1.zip" to access the "MedicalFraud1.csv" dataset.
- The Jupyter Notebook code(With extension .ipynb) with all the machine learning models can be found in the "Model.ipynb" file
